## ðŸ”§ Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying or sharing this repository, ensure:

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Create your own `.env` file from `.env.example`
- [ ] Replace all placeholder addresses with your actual addresses
- [ ] Set strong, unique private keys
- [ ] Configure secure RPC endpoints
- [ ] Test with small amounts first

### Network Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS endpoints for all API calls
- [ ] Implement proper WebSocket SSL connections
- [ ] Set up monitoring for unusual activity
- [ ] Configure alerts for failed transactions

### Operational Security
- [ ] Never share your `.env` file
- [ ] Keep private keys encrypted at rest
- [ ] Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- [ ] Regular backup of wallet seeds (offline)
- [ ] Monitor wallet activity regularly

## ðŸš¨ Security Warnings

### Critical Reminders
1. **Never commit private keys to version control**
2. **Always test with small amounts first**
3. **Keep your `.env` file local and secure**
4. **Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens**
5. **Monitor your wallets for unauthorized activity**

### Development Environment
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Keep production keys separate from development keys
- Use different wallets for different purposes
- Regular security audits of your code

### Production Environment
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Set up alerts for large transactions
- Use multi-signature wallets for significant funds
- Regular security reviews and updates

## ðŸ“‹ Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop all trading bots immediately
   - Move funds to a secure wallet
   - Rotate all API keys and secrets
   - Review recent transaction history

2. **Investigation**
   - Check logs for unusual activity
   - Review code for potential vulnerabilities
   - Verify integrity of configuration files
   - Check for unauthorized access to systems

3. **Recovery**
   - Update all security credentials
   - Patch any identified vulnerabilities
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Gradual restart of services with enhanced security

## ðŸ”’ Best Practices

### Wallet Management
- Use separate wallets for trading and storage
- Implement position size limits
- Regular backup of wallet information
- Monitor for suspicious transactions

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Security code reviews
- Input validation for all user data
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak information

### Infrastructure Security
- Use secure hosting environments
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security updates for systems
- Encrypted communications for all services
